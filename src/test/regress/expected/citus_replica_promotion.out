-- To simulate external promotion for testing the rebalance part:
-- 1. The UDF internally waits for WAL catchup (cannot easily test this part in CI without actual replication).
-- 2. The UDF then asks the user to promote the PG instance and waits for pg_is_in_recovery() to be false.
-- We will simulate this by directly calling the UDF.
-- The UDF has internal NOTICE messages for these steps. We will expect to see them.
-- The UDF also has a placeholder for GetNextGroupId. We expect a WARNING for that.
-- For pg_regress, we can't interactively promote. The UDF will likely timeout on pg_is_in_recovery()
-- unless we can somehow mock/trick it.
-- For now, let's test the error path if the replica is not "promoted" (i.e., pg_is_in_recovery is true).
-- This requires the UDF to be able to connect to the replica node port.
-- In pg_regress, these ports are not actually running separate PostgreSQL instances.
-- So, the connection attempt itself will likely fail for node 5437.

-- Let's assume replica node 3 (replica of node 2) was externally promoted.
-- Update its metadata to reflect this state *before* calling a rebalance (if rebalance was separate).
-- Since citus_promote_replica_and_rebalance does it all, we can't easily inject this.
-- What we can do is:
-- 1. Add a replica.
-- 2. Manually update its pg_dist_node entry to look like it's been promoted (active, not replica, new groupid).
-- 3. Then call a *new, separate* UDF like `citus_rebalance_shards_from_group(source_group_id, target_group_id, ratio)`
-- This is beyond the current subtask of testing the existing UDF.
-- For the existing UDF, the most we can test in a simple regress is:
-- - Initial validations (non-existent replica, non-replica node)
-- - The NOTICE messages for WAL sync and promotion instructions.
-- - The error that occurs when it tries to connect to the replica to check pg_is_in_recovery.
